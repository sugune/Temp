What is poverty? poverty is a state of living many people suffer from. it is the opposite of being rich. poverty occurs to a lot of people who lack major resources to live a proper life, and most of the people who live a life of poverty have accepted their fate and stopped themselves from trying to achieve their dreams.

Poverty is only a state of mind. Everything depends on what people think of themselves and what they could achieve, and accepting the fact that you are poor is similar to removing your ability to achieve what you could potentially achieve, and acknowledging that you can become rich is similar to removing your limitations and eventually find ways to escape poverty. There are people in poverty who tried to seek a life of luxury, but because of the state of their minds, most of them were not able to achieve their goals. Negative thoughts and constant failures led them to believe that it was impossible. The only solution to this is by working on themselves first, fixing their poor state of mind, having the right attitude, and surrounding themselves with positive thoughts.

Poverty is only a state of mind, just believe that you can and reality will bend itself according to your fantasies. And one thing to remember is that if something is important enough, you have to at least try even if the most probable outcome is a failure.
